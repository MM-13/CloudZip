2.      A webpage will open, klick on the blue button. The page will reload and a token will appear

3.      At the same time a file-explorer window will open

4.      You can not do anything until you have filled 
        in the token of you're google drive in the correct place
        
5.      Choose your map/directory you want to upload:
        !!!MAKE SURE THE MAP YOU CHOOSE IS A MAP WITH ONLY A MAP WITH THE FILES IN IT!!!
        !!!OTHERWISE THE SCRIPT WILL PUT ITSELF IN A LOOP AND IT WILL NOT WORK!!!
        
6.      After this everything will go automatically. Also the zipfile will be deleted from your pc
