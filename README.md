How it works:
1.      Run the .bat file

2.      A webpage will open, klick on the blue button. The page will reload and a acces token will appear

3.      Fill in the Api-token in the Gui(2 windows will pop up)

4.      Now a explorer window will pop up
        
5.      Choose your map/directory you want to upload:
        
6.      After this everything will go automatically. Also the zipfile will be deleted from your pc

Please do keep in mind I am still learning / a beginner.
