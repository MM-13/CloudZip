This program is still in b√®ta!
Their is a BUG which sometimes caueses the program to go into a loop.
I'm also making the program easier to use.

How it works:
1.      Run the .bat file

2.      A webpage will open, klick on the blue button. The page will reload and a acces token will appear

3.      At the same time a file-explorer window will open

4.      You can not do anything until you have filled 
        in the token of you're google drive in the correct place
        
5.      Choose your map/directory you want to upload:
        
6.      After this everything will go automatically. Also the zipfile will be deleted from your pc

Please do keep in mind I am still learning / a beginner.
